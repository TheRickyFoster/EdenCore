🌱 EdenCore: Planetary Revival Protocol

**EdenCore** is an open-source planetary regeneration framework designed to restore life across Earth after ecological collapse. By blending mycelial repair systems, genetic seedbank APIs, automation scripts, and DAO governance, EdenCore becomes a living blueprint for healing the planet—now or after humanity.

> 🌍 _“If Earth forgets how to grow, EdenCore remembers.”_

## 🧬 What Is It?

EdenCore is a **fully autonomous, zero-harm planetary reboot system**. It combines:
- Regenerative biology
- Distributed automation
- Mycelium-based soil repair
- Seed and DNA databanks
- DAO-controlled ethical protocols
- Drone + sensor deployment for real-world field execution

| `mycelial_mapper.py` | Simulates and spreads mycelial network repair in damaged zones |
| `dna_vault_linker.py` | Securely interfaces with global seedbanks and DNA reserves |
| `ethereal_sync.js` | Web3-enabled DAO sync and governance logic |
| `/hardware/` | Schematics for drones and sensors to detect and intervene |
| `/docs/` | Whitepaper, ethics, voting protocols |
| `/public_site/` | GitHub Pages site for open access + live documentation |
| `/legal/` | Custom license, patent drafts, copyright/trademark filings |
